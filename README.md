# The Parallel Hashmap

For a full writeup explaining the design and benefits of the Parallel Hashmap, please click [here](https://greg7mdp.github.io/parallel-hashmap/).


> This repository borrowed a lot of code from the [abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) repository, notably for the implementations of `phmap::flat_hash_map`, `phmap::flat_hash_set`, `phmap::node_hash_map` and `phmap::node_hash_set`. Please be aware that the code from [abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) has been modified, and may behave differently that the original. This repository should be construed as an independent work, with no guarantees of any kind implied or provided by the authors.
